Based in Peoria, Arizona, I offer local pickup and drop-off service for hassle-free computer, laptop, and motherboard repair.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        My background as an Apple Authorized Technician gave me years of experience repairing everything from MacBooks and PCs to logic boards and complex hardware issues. I saw how many shops quickly label devices as “non-repairable” and push expensive part replacement sometimes wiping important\r\n        data in the process. That’s not how I operate.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Unlike chain repair stores, I focus on board-level repair and microsoldering the advanced fixes that most shops won’t attempt. Whether it’s no power, charging port replacement, water damage repair, or motherboard troubleshooting, I aim to fix the exact problem instead of replacing entire\r\n        assemblies.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        I also offer phone and tablet repair as a secondary service, including screen replacement, battery swaps, and more.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        In addition to electronics repair, I’m studying Software Development and I even built this website from scratch. A to Z Repairs is more than a business; it’s the combination of passion, precision, and professionalism.\r\n        <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        If you need reliable computer, laptop, or motherboard repair, including advanced microsoldering services, I’m here to help. I serve customers throughout Peoria, Glendale, Surprise, Phoenix, Sun City, and the surrounding Arizona areas. Let’s get your tech back on track, from A to Z.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <Link href={\"/submitrepair\"}>\r\n        <button className={localstyles.repairBtn}>Repair Your Device</button>\r\n      </Link>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;AAAA;AACA;;;;AAGO,MAAM,WAAqB;IAChC,OAAO;IACP,aAAa;AACf;AAEe,SAAS;IACtB,qBACE,8OAAC;QAAI,WAAW,kIAAA,CAAA,UAAW,CAAC,IAAI;;0BAC9B,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAW,kIAAA,CAAA,UAAW,CAAC,WAAW;0BAAE;;;;;;0BACxC,8OAAC;gBAAE,WAAW,kIAAA,CAAA,UAAW,CAAC,UAAU;;oBAAE;kCAEpC,8OAAC;;;;;kCACD,8OAAC;;;;;oBAAK;kCAGN,8OAAC;;;;;kCACD,8OAAC;;;;;oBAAK;kCAGN,8OAAC;;;;;kCACD,8OAAC;;;;;oBAAK;kCAEN,8OAAC;;;;;kCACD,8OAAC;;;;;oBAAK;kCAEN,8OAAC;;;;;kCACD,8OAAC;;;;;oBAAK;;;;;;;0BAIR,8OAAC,4JAAA,CAAA,UAAI;gBAAC,MAAM;0BACV,cAAA,8OAAC;oBAAO,WAAW,kIAAA,CAAA,UAAW,CAAC,SAAS;8BAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAIlD","debugId":null}}]
